## üîç Automated Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
npm test lib/__tests__/anonymization.test.ts
```

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úì should remove CPR numbers
‚úì should remove phone numbers in various formats
‚úì should remove email addresses

### Integration Test Checklist

- [ ] Streaming endpoint anonymizes correctly
- [ ] Non-streaming endpoint anonymizes correctly
- [ ] Cache stores anonymized text only
- [ ] Resume generation uses anonymized text
- [ ] Compare mode works with anonymized data
- [ ] PDF reports show candidate names correctly

---

## üìä Monitoring in Production

### Console Log Indicators

Look for these log entries:
```
üîí Anonymized CV for John Doe: 4532 ‚Üí 4123 chars
```

This indicates:
- ‚úÖ Anonymization is active
- ‚úÖ Text was reduced (personal data removed)
- ‚úÖ Candidate name preserved

### Red Flags

**WARNING Signs**:
- No `üîí` logs appearing
- Text length unchanged (e.g., 4532 ‚Üí 4532)
- Sensitive data in cache tables

**Action**:
1. Check `lib/anonymization.ts` is imported
2. Verify function is called before `extractJobRelevantInfo`
3. Clear caches: `DELETE FROM cv_text_cache; DELETE FROM analysis_cache;`

---

## üîê GDPR Compliance Verification

### Manual Audit Procedure

1. **Database Check**:
```sql
-- Check cv_text_cache for sensitive data
SELECT 
  text_hash,
  LEFT(cv_text, 200) as preview,
  candidate_name
FROM cv_text_cache
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
LIMIT 10;
```

**Verify**:
- No email addresses in `cv_text`
- No phone numbers in `cv_text`
- No CPR numbers in `cv_text`
- `candidate_name` column may contain names (acceptable)

2. **OpenAI Request Inspection**:
   - Use browser DevTools Network tab
   - Check payload sent to OpenAI
   - Verify no raw personal data in request

3. **Cache Validation**:
```typescript
import { detectSensitiveInfo } from '@/lib/anonymization'

// In browser console after analysis
const cached = await fetch('/api/cache/check?hash=...').then(r => r.json())
const sensitive = detectSensitiveInfo(cached.cv_text)
console.log(sensitive) 
// Should show all false
```

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Analysis quality degraded after anonymization

**Symptoms**:
- Lower overall scores
- Missing technical skills in analysis
- "Concerns" mention lack of information

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check if regex patterns are too aggressive
2. Verify professional terms aren't being removed
3. Review console log character reduction

**Solution**:
- Adjust regex patterns in `lib/anonymization.ts`
- Test with specific CV causing issues
- Add exception patterns for domain-specific terms

### Issue: Personal data still visible in UI

**Symptoms**:
- Email/phone visible in PDF reports
- Addresses shown in analysis results

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check if data is in `candidateName` variable
2. Verify anonymization runs BEFORE analysis
3. Check if caching is bypassing anonymization

**Solution**:
- Clear all caches
- Verify call order in route handlers
- Check if old cached data is being used

### Issue: Candidate names showing as [PERSON]

**Symptoms**:
- UI shows "[PERSON]" instead of real name
- PDF reports have "[PERSON]" in candidate cards

**Diagnosis**:
- Anonymization running on candidate name itself
- Name extraction happening after anonymization

**Solution**:
- Ensure `candidateName` extracted BEFORE anonymization
- Pass `candidateName` to anonymization function
- Verify anonymization doesn't target the preserved name
