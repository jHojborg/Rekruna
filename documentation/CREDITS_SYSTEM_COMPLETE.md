# üéâ Credits System - COMPLETE!

## Status: ‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED

**Dato:** 15. Oktober 2025  
**System:** Rekruna CV Screening Platform  
**Feature:** Pay-per-use Credits System

---

## üìä What Was Built

### Phase 1: Database Foundation ‚úÖ
**Files Created:**
- `database_migrations/add_credit_system_complete.sql` - Main tables
- `database_migrations/test_credit_system.sql` - Test scripts

**Tables Created:**
1. `credit_balances` - Stores user credit balances
2. `credit_transactions` - Audit log for all credit movements
3. `user_subscriptions` - Links users to Stripe subscriptions

**Features:**
- Separate tracking for subscription vs purchased credits
- Auto-computed total_credits column
- RLS policies for security
- Automatic timestamp updates
- Performance indexes

**Tested:** ‚úÖ All manual tests passed in Supabase

---

### Step 2: Credits Service ‚úÖ
**File Created:**
- `lib/services/credits.service.ts` (410 lines)

**Methods Implemented:**
1. `hasEnoughCredits(userId, amount)` - Check credit availability
2. `deductCredits(userId, analysisId, amount)` - Deduct before processing
3. `refundAnalysis(userId, analysisId, amount, reason)` - Auto-refund on errors
4. `initializeBalance(userId)` - Initialize for new users
5. `getBalance(userId)` - Simple balance lookup

**Key Features:**
- Success/error return pattern (no thrown errors)
- Deduction priority: subscription first, then purchased
- Full transaction logging
- Type-safe interfaces
- Extensive comments and documentation

**Tested:** ‚úÖ All API tests passed (via test endpoint)

---

### Phase 3: Integration ‚úÖ
**File Modified:**
- `app/api/analyze/route.ts` (+97 lines, 0 breaking changes)

**Integration Points:**
1. **Credit Check** (after auth, before processing)
   - Checks if user has enough credits
   - Auto-initializes balance for new users
   - Returns 402 error if insufficient

2. **Credit Deduction** (before OpenAI calls)
   - Deducts exact amount needed
   - Logs transaction details
   - Follows priority rules (subscription ‚Üí purchased)

3. **Auto-Refund** (on processing failure)
   - Catches all processing errors
   - Automatically refunds deducted credits
   - Logs critical errors for manual review

**Business Rules Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Check credits BEFORE processing starts
- ‚úÖ Deduct credits BEFORE expensive AI work
- ‚úÖ Use subscription credits FIRST (they expire)
- ‚úÖ Auto-refund if system errors occur
- ‚úÖ Full audit trail of all transactions

**Tested:** ‚úÖ Live test with 3 CVs - credits deducted correctly (100 ‚Üí 97)

---

## üéØ Test Results

### Test 1: Normal Analysis (Success)
**Setup:** User with 100 subscription credits  
**Action:** Upload 3 CVs  
**Result:**
```
‚úÖ Credit check passed: 100 credits available
‚úÖ Deducted 3 credits. New balance: 97
   Transactions: 3 from subscription
‚úÖ CV analysis completed: 3/3 CVs processed successfully
```
**Database Verified:**
- Balance: 97 subscription credits ‚úì
- Transaction logged in credit_transactions ‚úì
- Analysis completed successfully ‚úì

## üîß Database Schema

### credit_balances
```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, references auth.users)
- subscription_credits (integer) - Expire monthly
- purchased_credits (integer) - Lifetime
- total_credits (computed) - Auto-calculated
- last_subscription_reset (timestamp)
- created_at, updated_at
```

### credit_transactions
```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, references auth.users)
- amount (integer) - Positive for add, negative for deduct
- balance_after (integer)
- credit_type ('subscription' | 'purchased')
- transaction_type (purchase, deduction, refund, etc.)
- stripe_payment_intent_id (text, nullable)
- analysis_id (text, nullable)
- description (text)
- created_at
```

### user_subscriptions
```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, references auth.users)
- stripe_customer_id (text)
- stripe_subscription_id (text)
- stripe_price_id (text)
- product_tier (pay_as_you_go, pro, business)
- monthly_credit_allocation (integer)
- status (active, past_due, canceled, etc.)
- current_period_start, current_period_end
- cancel_at_period_end (boolean)
- created_at, updated_at
```

---

## üéØ Business Logic

### Credit Deduction Priority
```
1. Always use subscription_credits FIRST (they expire monthly)
2. Then use purchased_credits (they're lifetime)
3. Never mix unless subscription credits run out
```

**Example:**
```
User has:
- 30 subscription credits
- 100 purchased credits
- Analyzes 50 CVs

Deduction:
- 30 from subscription (all of it)
- 20 from purchased (remaining)

Result:
- 0 subscription credits
- 80 purchased credits
```

### Monthly Reset (Future - Phase 2)
```
When subscription renews:
- subscription_credits ‚Üí Reset to tier allocation (400 for Pro)
- purchased_credits ‚Üí Keep unchanged (lifetime)
- old subscription credits ‚Üí Lost (no rollover)
```

## üîí Security Features

‚úÖ **Row Level Security (RLS)**
- Users can only view their own balances
- Users can only view their own transactions
- Server-side code uses service role to bypass RLS

‚úÖ **Input Validation**
- All amounts must be > 0
- User IDs validated
- Analysis IDs required for deductions

‚úÖ **Audit Trail**
- Every credit movement logged
- Transaction type tracked
- Timestamps for all operations
- Stripe payment IDs linked

‚úÖ **Error Handling**
- Database errors caught and logged
- User-friendly error messages
- Critical errors flagged for manual review

---

## üìà Performance

### Caching System
- Analysis results cached (avoid redundant OpenAI calls)
- Resume generation cached
- CV text cached temporarily (2 hours)

**Cache Tables (Optional):**
Run `/database_migrations/add_cache_tables.sql` to create:
- `analysis_cache`
- `resume_cache`
- `cv_text_cache`

### Concurrency
- Parallel CV processing (max 5 concurrent)
- Database transactions for atomicity
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

---

## ‚úÖ What Works

- [x] Create credit balance for users
- [x] Check if user has enough credits
- [x] Deduct credits before analysis
- [x] Priority deduction (subscription ‚Üí purchased)
- [x] Auto-refund on processing errors
- [x] Transaction logging (full audit trail)
- [x] Auto-initialize balance for new users
- [x] User-friendly error messages (Danish)
- [x] No breaking changes to existing features
- [x] Type-safe service layer
- [x] Extensive error handling
- [x] Performance optimized

---

## üöß What's NOT Built Yet (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Stripe Payment Integration
- [ ] Checkout endpoint (`/api/checkout`)
- [ ] Webhook handler (`/api/webhooks/stripe`)
- [ ] Purchase credits flow
- [ ] Subscription management
- [ ] Monthly credit reset
- [ ] Top-up packages

### Phase 4: Dashboard UI
- [ ] Display credit balance
- [ ] Purchase credits button
- [ ] Transaction history view
- [ ] Subscription management page
- [ ] Usage statistics

---

## üß™ How to Test

### Test Normal Flow
```
1. User should have credits in database
2. Upload CVs in app
3. Check console logs - should show credit deduction
4. Verify in Supabase:
   SELECT * FROM credit_balances WHERE user_id = 'xxx';
   SELECT * FROM credit_transactions WHERE user_id = 'xxx';
```

### Test Insufficient Credits
```sql
-- Set user credits to 1
UPDATE credit_balances 
SET subscription_credits = 1, purchased_credits = 0
WHERE user_id = 'xxx';

-- Try to upload 3 CVs
-- Expected: 402 error "Du mangler 2 credits"
```

### Test Complex Deduction
```sql
-- Set mixed credits
UPDATE credit_balances 
SET subscription_credits = 2, purchased_credits = 100
WHERE user_id = 'xxx';

-- Upload 5 CVs
-- Expected: 2 from subscription, 3 from purchased
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Failed to check credit balance"
**Cause:** User doesn't have credit_balances record  
**Fix:** Now auto-initializes (should not happen)

### "Insufficient credits"
**Cause:** User has less credits than CVs  
**Fix:** Give user credits or they need to purchase

### Cache warnings
**Cause:** Missing cache tables  
**Fix:** Run `/database_migrations/add_cache_tables.sql`

## üìû Support Information

**Database Queries:**
```sql
-- Check all users with credits
SELECT 
  u.email,
  cb.subscription_credits,
  cb.purchased_credits,
  cb.total_credits
FROM credit_balances cb
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = cb.user_id
ORDER BY cb.total_credits DESC;

-- Check recent transactions
SELECT 
  u.email,
  ct.transaction_type,
  ct.credit_type,
  ct.amount,
  ct.balance_after,
  ct.created_at
FROM credit_transactions ct
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = ct.user_id
ORDER BY ct.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Give user test credits
INSERT INTO credit_balances (user_id, subscription_credits, purchased_credits)
VALUES ('user-id-here', 100, 0)
ON CONFLICT (user_id) 
DO UPDATE SET subscription_credits = 100;
```
