## ⚡ 3-Step Quick Start

### Step 1: Run Database Schema (2 minutes)
```bash
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents from: database_migrations/add_credit_system_complete.sql
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. Verify you see: "✓ 3 tables created, 7 indexes, RLS enabled"
```

### Step 2: Get Test User ID (30 seconds)
```sql
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users LIMIT 1;
```
Copy the `id` value.

### Step 3: Run Tests (5 minutes)
```bash
1. Open: database_migrations/test_credit_system.sql
2. Find & Replace: 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE' → [paste your user ID]
3. Run sections 2-9 one by one
4. Verify results match expected values
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

After running all tests, you should have:

**credit_balances table:**
```
subscription_credits: 400
purchased_credits:    300
total_credits:        700 ← Auto-calculated
```

**credit_transactions table:**
```
6 rows total:
- 1 purchase
- 3 deductions  
- 1 refund
- 1 subscription_reset
```

**user_subscriptions table:**
```
1 row:
- tier: pro
- status: active
- monthly_allocation: 400
```

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

**❌ "relation credit_balances does not exist"**
→ Run `add_credit_system_complete.sql` first

**❌ "violates foreign key constraint"**  
→ User ID doesn't exist in `auth.users` table

**❌ "permission denied for table"**
→ RLS is blocking you - make sure you're authenticated

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] All 3 tables created
- [ ] All 7 indexes created  
- [ ] RLS enabled on all tables
- [ ] Test user has balance of 700 credits
- [ ] 6 transactions logged
- [ ] Deduction priority works (subscription first)
- [ ] Refund restores credits

## 📞 Tell Me When Ready

Once all tests pass, say:

**"Phase 1 tests passed ✓"**

Then I'll build **Step 2: Credits Service** 🎉
