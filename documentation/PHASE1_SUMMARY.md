# Phase 1: Database Foundation - COMPLETE ✓

## What Was Created

I've created **3 files** for you to complete Phase 1:

### 1. **Database Schema** (Production-Ready)
📄 `/database_migrations/add_credit_system_complete.sql`

**What's inside:**
- ✅ 3 tables: `credit_balances`, `credit_transactions`, `user_subscriptions`
- ✅ 7 indexes for fast queries
- ✅ RLS (Row Level Security) policies - users can only see their own data
- ✅ Triggers to auto-update `updated_at` timestamps
- ✅ Helper function to initialize user credits
- ✅ Verification queries to confirm everything worked

**Key features:**
- `total_credits` is a **computed column** (auto-calculates from subscription + purchased)
- Separate tracking for `subscription_credits` (expire monthly) vs `purchased_credits` (lifetime)
- Full audit trail in `credit_transactions` table
- Foreign keys link to `auth.users(id)`

---

### 2. **Test Scripts** (SQL)
📄 `/database_migrations/test_credit_system.sql`

**What's inside:**
Complete SQL scripts to test all scenarios:
- ✅ Initialize user balance
- ✅ Add credits (purchase)
- ✅ Deduct credits (analysis)
- ✅ Test deduction priority (subscription first, then purchased)
- ✅ Refund credits
- ✅ Monthly subscription reset
- ✅ Create subscription record
- ✅ View transaction history

**How to use:**
1. Find & Replace `'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE'` with actual user ID
2. Run each section step by step
3. Verify results after each step

---

### 3. **Testing Guide** (Documentation)
📄 `/documentation/phase1_testing_guide.md`

**What's inside:**
Step-by-step manual testing instructions with:
- ✅ Prerequisites checklist
- ✅ How to run the schema
- ✅ What to expect from each test
- ✅ Success criteria for each scenario
- ✅ Troubleshooting section
- ✅ Final verification checklist

---

## Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Run the Database Schema ⏱️ ~2 minutes

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** → SQL Editor
2. Open file: `/database_migrations/add_credit_system_complete.sql`
3. Copy entire contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"**

**Expected output:**
```
✓ 3 tables created
✓ 7 indexes created
✓ RLS enabled on all 3 tables
```

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created ⏱️ ~1 minute

At the bottom of the SQL output, you should see verification results:

**Tables:**
| table_name | column_count |
|------------|--------------|
| credit_balances | 7 |
| credit_transactions | 11 |
| user_subscriptions | 13 |

**RLS Status:**
| tablename | rls_enabled |
|-----------|-------------|
| credit_balances | true |
| credit_transactions | true |
| user_subscriptions | true |

### Step 3: Run Test Scripts ⏱️ ~10 minutes

**Option A - Quick Test (Recommended):**
1. Get a user ID from `auth.users`
2. Open `/database_migrations/test_credit_system.sql`
3. Replace `'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE'` with actual ID
4. Run sections 2-9 one at a time
5. Verify expected results

**Option B - Detailed Testing:**
Follow `/documentation/phase1_testing_guide.md` step by step

### Step 4: Confirm Success ✅

Tell me when you see:
- ✅ All 3 tables exist
- ✅ Test transactions logged correctly
- ✅ Balances update properly
- ✅ Priority deduction works (subscription first, then purchased)

## Database Schema Overview

### Table 1: credit_balances
```
Stores each user's credit balance

Columns:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, foreign key → auth.users)
- subscription_credits (integer, default 0)
- purchased_credits (integer, default 0)
- total_credits (computed: subscription + purchased)
- last_subscription_reset (timestamp)
- created_at, updated_at (timestamps)

Constraints:
- subscription_credits >= 0
- purchased_credits >= 0
- user_id is UNIQUE (one balance per user)
```

### Table 2: credit_transactions
```
Audit log for every credit movement

Columns:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, foreign key → auth.users)
- amount (integer, positive or negative)
- balance_after (integer, total after transaction)
- credit_type ('subscription' or 'purchased')
- transaction_type ('purchase', 'deduction', 'refund', etc.)
- stripe_payment_intent_id (text, nullable)
- analysis_id (text, nullable)
- description (text)
- metadata (JSONB)
- created_at (timestamp)

Constraints:
- credit_type IN ('subscription', 'purchased')
- transaction_type IN (5 valid types)
```

### Table 3: user_subscriptions
```
Links users to Stripe subscriptions

Columns:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, foreign key → auth.users)
- stripe_customer_id (text)
- stripe_subscription_id (text, unique, nullable)
- stripe_price_id (text, nullable)
- product_tier ('pay_as_you_go', 'pro', 'business')
- monthly_credit_allocation (integer, nullable)
- status ('active', 'past_due', 'canceled', etc.)
- current_period_start, current_period_end (timestamps)
- cancel_at_period_end (boolean)
- created_at, updated_at (timestamps)

Constraints:
- product_tier IN (3 valid tiers)
- status IN (6 valid statuses)
- user_id is UNIQUE (one subscription per user)
```

---

## Security Features ✓

All tables have **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled:

```sql
-- Users can ONLY view their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own credit balance" 
  ON credit_balances 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Same for transactions and subscriptions
```

**What this means:**
- Users can't see other users' balances
- Even if they try to query the database directly
- Server-side code can still access all data (with service role)

---

## What Phase 1 Does NOT Include

❌ **Credits Service** - Coming in Step 2  
❌ **Stripe Integration** - Coming in Phase 2  
❌ **Integration with `/app/api/analyze/route.ts`** - Coming in Phase 3  
❌ **UI Components** - Coming in Phase 4  

**This is intentional!** We're building the foundation first, then layering features on top.

---

## Questions to Answer Before Step 2

Once your tests pass, let me know:

1. ✅ Did all 3 tables create successfully?
2. ✅ Did the test scripts run without errors?
3. ✅ Are you seeing the expected credit balances?
4. ✅ Any questions or issues?

---

## Next: Step 2 - Credits Service

Once you confirm Phase 1 works, I'll build:

**`/lib/services/credits.service.ts`** with 3 methods:
- `hasEnoughCredits()` - Check if user can afford analysis
- `deductCredits()` - Take credits before analysis
- `refundAnalysis()` - Give back credits if analysis fails

This service will use the tables we just created.
